The sample XML file `input.xml` is used to test the parser.

The same video file `fps25.mp4` has a few features which are used to
test the code which listens for loud audio and the code which computes
video FPS.  To do so, `fps25.mp4` is six seconds long, beginning with
two seconds of silence, two seconds of noise, and two more seconds of
silence.  The frame rate is 25.
