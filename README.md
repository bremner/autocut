# Autocut

I needed a way to make videos for my [Calculus
MOOC](http://mooculus.osu.edu/) very quickly, and so I build the
`autocut`ter.

This tool takes a list of video files, listens to the audio to
determine where I start and stop speaking, and builds an edit list
suitable for [MLT](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt).

If you want help using it, please feel free to contact me.
