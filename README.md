# Autocut

I needed a way to make videos for my [Calculus
MOOC](http://mooculus.osu.edu/) very quickly, and so I build the
`autocut`ter.

This tool takes a list of video files, listens to the audio to
determine where I start and stop speaking, and builds an edit list
suitable for [MLT](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt).

If you want help using it, please feel free to contact me.

## Requirements

There are some standalone packages to install:

* [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) extracts the audio from the movies;
* [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) does some audio processing;
* [MLT](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt) produces the final version; and
* [MP4Box](http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/mp4box/) prepares the video for streaming.

This is a ruby script, and it expects that you have installed some gems:

* [libxml-ruby](http://xml4r.github.io/libxml-ruby/) for parsing the `XML` generated by MLT,
* [wavefile](https://github.com/jstrait/wavefile) for handling `wav` files, and
* [fftw3](https://github.com/evan/fftw3) for doing the Fourier transform.
